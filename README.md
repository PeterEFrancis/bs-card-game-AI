# bs-card-game-AI

This repository holds the software for development of an AI player for the card game "BS".

### Rules:

At the beginning of a game, each of the 4 players are dealt 13 cards each. The first person who has 0 cards wins. Player turns rotate, starting with the player who is dealt the ace of spades, who only discards the ace. Each turn the turn rank increments and the playing player must discard from their hand, face down, onto the pile. If a player believes that the discarded cards are not all of the current turn rank, they may call "BS". If the discard was a bluff, the entire pile (excluding the ace of spaces) is added to the playing player's hand. If the discard was not a bluff, the pile (excluding the ace of spades) is added to the calling player's hand.
